PyGeode 1.0
=================================

Welcome! PyGeode is a python package intended to simplify the manipulation,
analysis and visualization of geophysical datasets, such as those generated by
climate models. It is particularly suited to dealing with large datasets that
don't fit into memory. It is also intended to simplify plotting this data with
matplotlib_. For more of an introduction, see the :doc:`tutorial`.

This documentation will describe version 1.0, it is still a work in progress.
