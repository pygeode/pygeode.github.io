File Input and Output
=====================

.. currentmodule:: pygeode

Serialized data stored in files on disk (or over the network) can be imported
into PyGeode with the routines :func:`open` (for single files), :func:`openall`
(for small numbers of files), and :func:`open_multi` (for large numbers of
files).  Variables and datasets can be saved to disk with :func:`save`. 

.. _formats:

Several formats are supported natively by pygeode, including NetCDF (versions 3
and 4), HDF (versions 4 and 5) and grib files, though support for NetCDF and
HDF is the most complete. By default the format is detected through the file extension;
however, many of the methods below accept an optional ``format`` argument which can be used to 
specify the format explicitly. 

========= ============  ================= =========
Format    Extension     String Identifier Notes
========= ============  ================= =========
NetCDF    .nc           netcdf
HDF5                    netcdf            Uses the same library as NetCDF
NetCDF4   .nc           netcdf4           Requires the netCDF4_ package.
HDF4      .hdf          hdf4
GRIB      .grib         grib
========= ============  ================= =========

Plugins for other formats are available in add-on packages, such as
`pygeode-rpn`_ for reading *RPN Standard Files* from Environment and Climate
Change Canada.

Code also exists to read the native binary format used by the Canadian Centre
for Climate Modeling and Analysis, but this is not distributed with PyGeode by
default.
